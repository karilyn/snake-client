# Snake Client Project

Snake is an old school video game, where a player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‘eating’ pieces of food on the screen. As the snake moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre. It is a heavily modified version of the single player game [Snek](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek) created by [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia).

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
